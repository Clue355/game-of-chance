objective: 

Implement at least one of the following games using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will be a project you include in your portfolio, so make it look nice, and use GitLab's Pages feature to host your finished game so that anyone can play it.

All these games will need generate random numbers, like in the dice-rolling activity from a few weeks ago.
